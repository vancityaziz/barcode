### Inventory Management System

(forked from Adam Samy, team member who took the lead in this prototype, which was part of a larger project)

This is an inventory management system that utilizes a barcode scanner to efficiently track raw materials moving between warehouses and production units. This was part of our project for APS112: Engineering Strategies & Practice at University of Toronto. Our client was TAIJI Group USA.
